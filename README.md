# Devtools

The relevant code is under /packages/devtools/src.

The test app and the devtools are provided under /test-apps/react-router-esm.

## Run the test app

Run the following command to start the test app:

```bash

pnpm install

pnpm run dev
```

If the styles don't render properly, change something in the src/client to trigger a rebuild until it renders correctly.
